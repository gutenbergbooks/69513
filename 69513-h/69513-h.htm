<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION.</h2>
</div>

<p>The fact that the first edition of this little manual is entirely
exhausted is a sufficient indication that it supplied a want. As the
use of the Aneroid Barometer is on the increase, the presumption is that
there will be a further demand for this book of tables and instructions.</p>

<p>It has been thought advisable to rearrange the matter and to increase
it by fuller descriptions of different instruments; and what is of more
importance to the novice in measuring altitudes, to add a number of examples.</p>

<p>Another table has also been added to the collection of the previous edition.</p>

<p>The gaseous envelope which surrounds our globe, and to which we give
the name of atmosphere, is subject to many and varied changes. In the
relative amount of the two gases which chiefly compose it, it remains
marvelously constant; yielding upon analysis the same ratio of oxygen
to nitrogen for all latitudes and all altitudes. It is only within a
few restricted and generally confined areas where the natural chemical
processes of respiration, combustion or fermentation are active, that
the free oxygen is found to be notably deficient, and the product,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
carbonic dioxide, which exists normally to the extent of one
twenty-fifth of one per cent., is, to a corresponding extent, in excess.</p>

<p>When, however, we regard the conditions which arise from its physical
properties, no such constancy is observable. Indeed, it seems the
most fitting type of a transitory state, and whether we regard the
temperature, the moisture, the pressure resulting from its weight,
or the direction and velocity of its motions, we can only acquaint
ourselves with the limits within which these conditions have been known
to vary. The nature of the changes within these limits we cannot, in
the present state of our knowledge, assume to predict for the future,
except for very limited periods; and even then the prediction is set
forth only as a “probability.”</p>

<p>Certain average conditions are noticeable as belonging to certain
areas or zones of the earth, and differing somewhat among themselves,
especially as to greater or less range in temperature, moisture, etc.
To such general conditions we apply the term <i>climate</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>The department of science which regards the physical phenomena arising
from these varying conditions is called meteorology. The instruments
employed with which to indicate or measure the extent of these
changes, are of various kinds. Thus the <i>thermometer</i> indicates
the relative temperature, the <i>hygrometer</i> the humidity, the
<i>anemometer</i> the force or the velocity of the wind, and the <i>barometer</i>
the pressure of the air which arises directly from its weight.</p>

<p>It is with the last of these instruments that we are especially
concerned in the present essay. It has two quite distinct uses: One
to indicate the varying pressures of the air at some fixed point for
meteorological purposes, and the other to indicate difference in
altitude of points to which the instrument is carried by affording
a measure of the greater or less amount of atmosphere above it.
Before using the instrument to measure altitudes it is important to
become somewhat familiar with its use as a stationary instrument. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
barometer most frequently employed for such use is the one invented by
Toricelli in 1643. It is too well known to require description here.
It will be sufficient to say that it measures the varying pressure of
the air by the varying length of a column of mercury which balances the
pressure.</p>

<p>When the barometer is employed for the purposes of meteorology only,
the following facts are taken into consideration. We quote from
Buchan’s “Handy Book of Meteorology.”</p>

<p><i>Variations of the Barometer.</i>—The variations observed in the
pressure of the air may be divided into two classes, viz., periodical
and irregular; the periodical variations recurring at regular
intervals, whilst the irregular variations observe no stated times. The
most marked of the periodical variation is the <i>daily variation</i>,
the regularity of which in the tropics is so great that, according to
Humboldt, the hour may be ascertained from the height of the barometer
without an error of more than 15 or 17 minutes on the average. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
horary oscillation of the barometer is masked in Great Britain by
the frequent fluctuations to which the atmosphere is subjected in
these regions. It is, however, detected by taking the mean of a
series of hourly observations conducted for some time. The results
show two maxima occurring from 9 to 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
and from 9 to 11 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and two minima
occurring from 3 to 5 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and from 3 to 5
<span class="smcap">p.m.</span> (<a href="#Page_10">See Table, page 10</a>.)</p>

<p>The maxima occur when the temperature is about the mean of the day, and
the minima when it is at the highest and lowest respectively.</p>

<p>This daily fluctuation of the barometer is caused by the changes which
take place from hour to hour of the day in the temperature, and by the
varying quantity of vapor in the atmosphere.

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
The surface of the globe is always divided into a day and night
hemisphere, separated by a great circle which revolves with the sun
from east to west in twenty-four hours. These two hemispheres are thus
in direct contrast to each other in respect of heat and evaporation.
The hemisphere exposed to the sun is warm, and that turned in the other
direction is cold. Owing to the short time in which each revolution
takes place, the time of greatest heat is not at noon, when the sun is
in the meridian, but about two or three hours thereafter; similarly,
the period of greatest cold occurs about four in the morning. As the
hemisphere under the sun’s rays becomes heated, the air, expanding
upwards and outwards, flows over upon the other hemisphere where the
air is colder and denser. There thus revolves round the globe from day
to day, a wave of heat, from the crest of which air constantly tends to
flow towards the meridian of greatest cold on the opposite side of the globe.</p>

<p>The barometer is influenced to a large extent by the elastic force of
the vapor of water invisibly suspended in the atmosphere, in the same
way as it is influenced by the dry air (oxygen and hydrogen). But the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
vapor of water also exerts a pressure on the barometer in another way.
Vapor tends to diffuse itself equally through the air; but as the
particles of air offer an obstruction to the watery particles, about
9 or 10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, when evaporation is most rapid,
the vapor is accumulated or pent up in the lower stratum of the atmosphere,
and being impeded in its ascent its elastic force is increased by the
reaction, and the barometer consequently rises. When the air falls
below the temperature of the dew-point, part of its moisture is
deposited in dew, and since some time must elapse before the vapor of
the upper strata can diffuse itself downwards to supply the deficiency,
the barometer falls—most markedly at 10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>,
when the deposition of dew is greatest.</p>

<p>Hence, as regards temperature, the barometer is subject to a maximum
and minimum pressure each day—the maximum occurring at the period of
greatest cold, and the minimum at the period of greatest heat. And as
regards vapor in the atmosphere, the barometer is subject to two maxima
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
and minima of pressure—the maxima occurring at 10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>,
when, owing to the rapid evaporation, the accumulation of vapor near the
surface is greatest, and about sunset, or just before dew begins to be
deposited, when the relative amount of vapor is great; and the minima
in the evening, when the deposition of dew is greatest, and before
sunrise, when evaporation and the quantity of vapor in the air is least.</p>

<p>Thus the maximum in the forenoon is brought about by the rapid
evaporation arising from the dryness of the air and the increasing
temperature. But as the vapor becomes more equally diffused, and the
air more saturated, evaporation proceeds more languidly; the air
becomes also more expanded by the heat, and flows away to meet the
diurnal wave of cold advancing from the eastwards. Thus the pressure
falls to the afternoon minimum about 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> From this
time the temperature declines, the air approaches more nearly the point of
saturation, and the pressure being further increased by accessions of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
air from the warm wave, now considerably to the westward, the evening
maximum is attained. As the deposition of dew proceeds, the air becomes
drier, the elastic pressure of the vapor is greatly diminished, and the
pressure falls to a second minimum about 4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span></p>

<p>The amount of these daily variations diminishes from the equator
towards either pole, for the obvious reason that they depend, directly,
or indirectly, on the heating power of the sun’s rays. Thus, while
at the equator the daily fluctuation is 0.125 inch, in Great Britain
it is only a sixth part of that amount. It is very small in the
high latitudes of St. Petersburg and Bossekop; and in still higher
latitudes, at that period of the year when there is no alternation of
day and night, the diurnal variation probably does not occur. In the
dry climate of Barnaul, in Siberia, there is no evening maximum; the
lowest minimum occurs as early as midnight, and the only maximum at 9
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>Since the whole column of the atmosphere, from the sea level upwards,
expands during the heat of the day, thus lifting a portion of it above
all places at higher levels, it is evident that the afternoon minimum
at high stations will be less than at lower stations, especially when
the ascent from the one to the other is abrupt. Thus, at Padua, in
Italy, the afternoon minimum is 0.014 inch, but at Great St. Bernard it
is only 0.003 inch.</p>

<p><i>Annual Variation.</i>—When it is summer in the one hemisphere,
it is winter in the other. In the hemisphere where summer prevails,
the whole air being warmer than in the other hemisphere, expands both
vertically and laterally. As a consequence of the lateral expansion
there follows a transference of part of the air from the warm to the
cold hemisphere along the earth’s surface; and, as a consequence
of the vertical expansion, an overflow in the upper regions of the
atmosphere in the same direction. Hence, in so far as the dry air of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
the atmosphere is concerned, the atmospheric pressure will be least
in the summer and greatest in the winter of each hemisphere. But the
production of aqueous vapor by evaporation being most active in summer,
the pressure on the barometer will be much increased from this cause.
As the aqueous vapor is transferred to the colder hemisphere it will
be there condensed into rain, and being thereby withdrawn from the
atmosphere, the barometer pressure will be diminished; but the dry air
which the vapor brought with it from the warm hemisphere will remain,
thus tending to increase the pressure.</p>

<p>In the neighborhood of the equator there is little variation in the
mean pressure from month to month. Thus, at Cayenne, the pressure in
January is 29.903 inches, and in July 29.957 inches.</p>

<p>At Calcutta, 22° 36' N. lat., the pressure is 29.408 in July, and
30.102 in January, thus showing a difference of 0.694; and at Rio de
Janeiro, 22° 57' S. lat., it is 29.744 in January (summer), and 29.978
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
in July (winter), the difference being 0.234. The large annual
variation at Calcutta is caused jointly by the great heat in July, and
by the heavy rains which accompany the south-west monsoons at this
season; while in January the barometer is high, owing to the north-east
monsoons, by which the dry cold dense air of Central Asia is conveyed
southward over India.</p>

<p>At places where the amount of vapor in the air varies little from month
to month, but the variations of temperature are great, the difference
between the summer and winter pressures are very striking. Thus,
at Barnaul and Irkutsk, both in Siberia, the pressures in July are
respectively 29.243 and 28.267, and in January 29.897 and 28.865, the
differences being upwards of six-tenths of an inch. The great heat of
Siberia during summer causes the air to expand and flow away in all
directions, and the diminished pressure is not compensated for by any
material accessions being made to the aqueous vapor of the atmosphere;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
and, on the other hand, the great cold and little rain in that region
during winter causes high pressures to prevail during that season. The
same peculiarity is seen, though in a modified degree, at Moscow, St.
Petersburg, and Vienna.</p>

<p>At Reykjavik, in Iceland, the pressure in June is 29.717, and in
December 29.273; at Sandwich, Orkney, 29.775, and 29.586; and at
Sitcha, in Russian America, 29.975, and 29.664. In all these places
the distribution of the pressure is just the reverse of what obtains
in Siberia, being least in winter and greatest in summer. The high
summer pressures are due to the cool summer temperatures as compared
with surrounding countries, thus causing an <i>inflow from these
regions</i>, and to the large amount of vapor in the atmosphere, thus
still further raising the barometric column. On the other hand, the low
winter pressures are due to the comparatively high winter temperatures
causing an <i>outflow towards adjoining countries</i>, and the large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
winter rainfall which, by setting free great quantitles of latent heat,
still farther augments and accelerates the outflow.</p>

<p>The variations in mean pressure are very slight, and not marked by
any very decided regularity in their march through the seasons, at
Dublin, Glasgow, London, Paris, and Rome. As compared with Barnaul and
Reykjavik their temperature is at no season very different from that
of surrounding countries, and the vapor and rainfall are at no time
much in excess or defect, but are more equally distributed over the
different months of the year.</p>

<p>At the Great St. Bernard, 8174 feet above the sea, the pressure in
summer is 22.364 inches, while in winter it is only 22.044. At Padua,
there is scarcely any difference in the pressure between summer and
winter. The increase in the summer pressure at the Great St. Bernard is
no doubt due to the same cause already referred to in art. 65—viz.,
the expansion of the air upward during the warm summer months, thus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
raising a larger portion of it above the barometer at the highest
station. But at St. Fe de Bogota, 8615 feet high, near the equator, and
where, consequently, the difference between the temperature in July
and January is very small, the difference in the pressures of the same
months is also very small, being only 0.035.</p>

<p><i>Distribution of Atmospheric Pressure over the globe, as determined
by the Annual Means.</i>—Though much additional observation is
required, especially in Africa, Asia, and South America, before the
isobarometric lines can be laid down on a map of the world, yet many
important conclusions regarding the mean barometric pressure have
been arrived at from the results already obtained. We have seen that
the daily and monthly variations of pressure observed at different
places are modified by the variations of the temperature of the air,
the amount of vapor, and the rainfall. Since these are in their turn
greatly modified by the unequal distribution of land and water on
the earth’s surface, we should expect to find the pressure, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
variations in the pressure, most regular in the southern hemisphere.
Accordingly, there is a remarkable regularity observed in the
distribution of the pressure from about 40° N. lat. southwards to the
Antarctic Ocean, with the exception of the region of the monsoons in
Southern Asia.</p>

<p>The mean pressure in the equatorial regions is about 29.90; at 20°
N. lat. it rises to 30.00, and at 35° N. lat. to 30.20, from which
northwards the pressure is diminished. The same peculiarity is seen
south of the equator, but it is not so strongly marked. At 45° S. lat.
it falls to 29.90, and from this southwards it continues steadily
and rapidly to fall to a mean pressure of 28.91 at 75° S. lat. This
extraordinary depression of the barometer in the Antarctic Ocean,
being one inch less than at the equator and 1,326 inches less than at
Algiers, is perhaps the most remarkable fact in the meteorology of the
globe.</p>

<p>The pressure in the north temperate and frigid zones is in striking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
contrast to the above. From Athens, in a north-eastern direction, a
high isobarometric line traverses Asia, passing in its course Tiflis,
Barnaul, Irkutsk, and Yakutsk. To the east of the northern part of
this area of high mean pressure, around the peninsula of Kamtschatka,
there is a region of low barometer, the mean pressure being only
29.682. There is another remarkable area of low pressure around
Iceland, the center being probably in the south-west of the island near
Reykjavik, where the mean is 29.578. As observations are more numerous
in Europe and North America, the dimensions of this depression may
be defined with considerable precision by drawing the isobarometric
of 29.90, which is about the mean atmospheric pressure. This line
passes through Barrow Straits in North America, thence south-eastward
toward Newfoundland, then eastward through the north of Ireland, the
south of Scotland, and the south of Sweden, whence it proceeds in a
north-easterly direction to Spitzbergen. The following mean annual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
pressures will show the nature of the depression: New York, 30.001;
Paris, 29.988; London, 29.956; Glasgow, 29.863; Orkney, 29.781;
Bergen, 29.804; Spitzbergen, 29.794; Reykjavik, 29.578; Godthaab, in
S. Greenland, 29.605; Upernavik, in N. Greenland, 29.732; and Melville
Island, 29.807. A depression also occurs in India, where the mean is
only about 29.850, whereas in the same latitudes elsewhere it is about
30.100.</p>

<p>There are thus four areas of low pressure on the globe, the extent
of each being nearly proportioned to the depth of the central
depression—viz., Antarctic Ocean, the least pressure being 28.910;
Iceland, 29.578; Kamtschatka, 29.682; and India, 29.850; and three
areas of high pressure, one lying between latitudes 20° and 40° N.,
another between 15° and 35° S., and the third in Central Asia, from
south-west to north-east. These low mean pressures are by no means
constant in all cases during the months of the year. In the Antarctic
Ocean they are nearly constant during the months, with perhaps a slight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
tendency to an increase in winter. In the region of low pressure around
Iceland the pressure is a little less than elsewhere in summer; but
in winter, when the rainfall is heaviest, it is very much less, being
0.251 inch less in winter than in summer at Reykjavik, and 0.189 at
Sandwich, in Orkney. Similarly at Petropaulovski, in Kamtschatka,
the pressure in winter is 0.323 less than in summer. Hence the low
mean annual pressures in the North Atlantic and the North Pacific are
chiefly brought about by the low pressure during the cold months of
the year, and are doubtless caused by the copious rainfall during that
season. On the other hand, in Southern Asia, the lowest pressures occur
in summer. Thus, at Calcutta it is 29.408 in July, while in January
it is 30.102—the average pressure for that degree of north latitude.
Hence, in Hindostan, the low mean annual pressure arises from the
very low pressure in summer caused by the heavy rains falling at that
season, particularly on the south slope of the Himalayas. Generally the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
pressure is low wherever a copious rainfall prevails over a
considerable portion of the earth’s surface, owing to the large
quantity of caloric set free as the vapor is condensed into rain.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to point out how important it is to keep in
mind these facts of the pressure of the atmosphere, it being evident,
for instance, that a pressure of 29.00 in the North Atlantic would
portend stormy winds, while the same pressure south of Cape Horn, being
the mean pressure there, would indicate settled weather.</p>

<p>The readings of the mercurial barometer are subjected in nice

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br><span class="h_subtitle">BAROMETRIC MEASUREMENTS<br> OF ALTITUDES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The text books in physics present formulas for computing heights from
barometric observations, based on physical laws which we will briefly give.</p>

<p>If the density of the air were constant throughout, the measurement of
heights would be a problem of the simplest character; for as mercury
weighs 10,500 times as much as air at the sea level, the mercurial
column would fall one inch for every 10,500 inches of ascent above the
sea. But air is compressible, and, in accordance with Boyle’s law, its
density varies with the pressure to which it is subjected.</p>

<p>Now suppose the atmosphere divided into layers of uniform thickness,
but so thin that the density may be considered uniform throughout.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">Let&emsp;<i>h</i> = the thickness of each layer.<br>
<span class="ws3">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;W = weight of a cubic foot of air at pressure H.<br>
<span class="ws3">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;W₁ = weight of a cubic foot of air at H.<br>
&nbsp;H₀ H₁, &amp;c. = pressures measured in inches of mercury.</p>

<p>Then the pressure upon the unit of surface of any layer is greater
than that upon the surface of next higher layer, by the weight of a
volume of air whose base is the unit of surface and whose height is the
thickness of the layer. If one foot be the unit of surface, then this
quantity would be <i>h</i>W. And to express it by height of mercury
column, it is necessary to multiply by</p>

For use in accurate observations, corrections are required for
temperature, humidity and variation in the force of gravity.</p>

<p>La Place’s formula which includes terms derived from the consideration
of these conditions is obtained as follows:</p>

<p>Suppose a portion of the atmosphere included between two stations at
different altitudes to be divided into very thin laminæ.</p>

<p>Let <i>z</i> be the distance of one of these from the surface of the
globe and <i>dz</i> its thickness.</p>

<p>Let P be the pressure upon a unit of surface upon the lower side
of this layer; and W the weight per cubic meter of the air at this
pressure.</p>

<p>Then the pressure on the upper side will be less than P by an amount
equal to the weight of a column of air whose base is a unit and height
is equal to <i>dz</i>.</p>

<p>Whence</p>

<p>If W₀ be the weight of a cubic meter of air at the temperature 0°C
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
and a barometric pressure of 0.ᵐ76, the weight of this same volume at

<p class="no-indent"><i>a</i> being the coefficient of dilatation of
air which is here taken at .004 in consequence of the constant presence
of watery vapor.</p>

<p>This expresses the weight at the surface of the globe. If transferred
to the height <i>z</i>, the weight would be diminished in the ratio of
the squares of the distances from the center of the earth. We should
then have</p>

<p>Substituting in equation 1, dividing by P and integrating between 0 and

<p>But the pressures P₀ and P are in direct ratio of the mercury
columns which we will designate by <i>h₀</i> and <i>h</i>. These
columns also vary in weight in accordance with the law of inverse
squares of distance from the earth’s center, so that</p>

<p>Substituting in the value of <i>z</i>, we have</p>

<p>The weight W₀ refers to the height <i>h</i>₁ the lower of the two

compared with R this correction may be neglected.</p>

<p>But there is another of more importance which should be taken into
account. On account of the spheroidal form of the globe weight varies
with the latitude. If G represent the weight of a body at latitude
45°, then at any other latitude <i>l</i>, its weight, is found by
multiplying G by</p>

<p><span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 17.027ex; height: 1.756ex;" src="images/21.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\[

\]"></span></p>

<p>This factor is to be applied to W₀ in the formula. This is accomplished
by multiplying the above value of <i>z</i> by <img style="vertical-align: -0.186ex; width: 17.027ex; height: 1.756ex;" src="images/22.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(1 + .00265 \cos. 2l.\)"></p>

<p>In order to simplify the expression we will substitute for <img style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.061ex; height: 1.618ex;" src="images/23.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\theta\)">

<p>The three terms after the first are the corrections. The first being
that for the temperature at the two stations. The second is the
correction for the force of gravity depending on the latitude.</p>

<p>The third contains, first the correction for action of gravity on the
mercury column at the elevation <i>z</i>, and second a correction
required for decrease in density of air owing to decrease in action
of gravity at the greater elevation. The factor <i>s</i> being the
approximate difference in altitude of the stations.</p>

<p>Plantamour’s formula, which has been much used, differs slightly
from Guyot’s. The first coefficient is 60384.3. The denominator of
temperature term is 982.26 and a separate correction is used for
humidity of the air.</p>

<p>To use either of these formulas tables are necessary, of which those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
prepared by Lieut. Col. Williamson<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
are the most elaborate.</p>

<p>For the Aneroid in ordinary practice, formulas of much less complexity
may be profitably used. The corrections depending upon the gravity
of the mercury column would, in any case, be omitted. The other
corrections may in very nice work be retained. But a correction
depending on the effect of changes of temperature on the metallic work
of the instrument should be carefully remembered. First-class Aneroids
claim to be <i>compensated</i>, but a greater portion will need a
correction which the purchaser can determine for himself, by subjecting
the instrument to different temperatures while the pressure remains
constant.</p>

<p>A modification of Guyot’s formula adapted to aneroid work was suggested
in an excellent paper on the use of the aneroid, read before the
American Society of Civil Engineers, in January, 1871.

</div>

<p>The general principle of construction of all aneroids is the same. A
box with flexible sides, hermetically sealed, the air having been first
exhausted, changes its form as the pressure of the atmosphere varies.</p>

<p>The chief differences in the various kinds lie in the mechanical
devices, by which the motions of the box are rendered apparent to the
eye, and also measured in such a manner as to allow the corresponding
pressures to be expressed in inches of mercury.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>The aneroid was invented about the beginning of this century, but was
first made of a serviceable form by Vidi, in 1848. It is substantially
the form most used to-day. The vacuum box is a thin low cylinder,
and the motion of the thin flexible head of the cylinder is conveyed
by suitable mechanism to the index hand. Vidi’s aneroid is shown in
<a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>. D is the vacuum box, supporting the upright pillar
M upon its center. As M rises or falls, a corresponding motion is given to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
plate C. A counter-pressure is afforded by the spiral spring S. The
motion of C is conveyed by the links 1 and 2 to a little rocker shaft,
shown in the <a href="#FIG_1">figure</a>. An arm, 3, attached to this
shaft is connected by a minute chain with the shaft which carries the
index pointer. It is kept wound to the proper tension about this shaft
by a fine spiral hair spring.</p>

This is Naudet’s aneroid, and is the one chiefly employed now.
It differs from Vidi’s in the substitution of the thin

<p>One of the oldest forms of <i>box</i> barometer and the one to which
the name <i>aneroid</i> is restricted by some writers, is represented in
<a href="#FIG_4">Fig. 4</a>. A rectangular tube, from which the air has been perfectly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
exhausted, is sealed hermetically, and, having been bent into the
form represented in the figure by <i>cbd</i>, is made fast at the
middle point <i>b</i>. The varying pressure of the atmosphere causes
the extremities <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> to approach or recede from each
other. This motion is converted into a to-and-fro traverse of the
index, by a mechanism sufficiently well exhibited by the diagram.</p>

<p>This is known as Bourdon’s form. It is not now employed for delicate
work. The forms of Vidi and Naudet are, by some writers, designated the
<i>holosteric</i> barometers.</p>

<p>The graduation of these instruments is made to correspond with the
height of the mercurial barometer, and is expressed as inches or
millimeters.</p>

<p>The difficulties to be met by the maker, in securing accuracy of
working, are those which arise chiefly from the varying elasticity of
the several metallic elements under change of temperature. Greater
simplicity of construction might be presumed to be attended with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
smaller liability to a kind of error, for which it is exceedingly
difficult to compensate. This is the theory of the Goldschmid Aneroid.</p>

<p>The instrument designed for ordinary engineering use is represented by
<a href="#FIG_5">Fig. 5</a>. The size recommended by the present makers for
this service is 3⅛ inches in diameter and 2½ inches high.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>The construction is exhibited by <a href="#FIG_6">Fig. 6</a>. The vacuum box,
constructed as before described, is shown at <i>aa</i>. The motions of the box,
caused by variations of atmospheric pressure, are conveyed directly
to the lever, whose fulcrum is at <i>e</i>″, and whose free end is
at <i>e</i>. This end, projecting through the side of the casing and
working freely through a slot, is observed with a magnifying lens, and
the reading on the index <i>ff</i> taken. But it is evident that the
lever, working with proper ease on its fulcrum, must be supplied with a
certain amount of counter-pressure. This is ingeniously done by aid of
the delicate spring <i>e'</i>, which is attached to the lever near the
fulcrum. Bearing on the spring is the point of the micrometer screw M,
whose head is graduated to hundredths and forms the top of the case.
Both lever and spring are furnished at their extremities with bright
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
metal heads, whose end surfaces lie in the same plane. The head
<i>e</i>' is, under ordinary conditions, higher than <i>e</i>, as shown
in <a href="#FIG_6">Fig. 6</a>. When a reading is to be taken the top of
the case is turned until <i>e'</i> and <i>e</i> are side by side; the
horizontal marks borne on the metallic heads being brought to an exact
coincidence by aid of a lens (<a href="#FIG_5"><b>P</b> in Fig. 5</a>).
The reading of the <i>inches</i> is taken from the scale <i>ff</i>,
and of the hundredths from the divisions on the scale around the top
of the box T; a fixed point <i>c</i> being marked on the cylinder. In
<a href="#FIG_7">figure 7</a> the indices exhibit a reading of 29.75 inches.</p>

<p>The thermometer F is an important part of the instrument.</p>

<p>In some of these instruments the scale <i>ff</i> bears no reference
to the inches of the mercurial barometer, but is of an arbitrary
character, and is different for different instruments. The value of the
divisions is determined by comparison with standard instruments, and is
carefully expressed in tabular form on the cover of the box.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>Some corrections for temperature and pressure are required in the use
of these instruments which, although desirable in the more common
forms of aneroid, have not heretofore been considered necessary. In
the latter instruments, however, when of the best construction, a
<i>compensation</i> has been effected which renders a correction for
temperature unnecessary. In the Goldschmid aneroids no compensation is
attempted, but each instrument is furnished with a <a href="#Page_49">table of corrections</a>
which have been prepared from observation on standard instruments.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that all aneroids need a careful comparison with
standard instruments or a series of trials upon known altitudes, in
order to determine the proper corrections. Such trials should be made
at different temperatures and under different conditions as to rising
or falling at the time of observation. The tables of corrections
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
furnished by the maker cannot well be substituted for those made by a
careful observer deduced from systematic work. The air pump, the hot
chamber and the freezing box are convenient, but inadequate substitutes
for a large number of trials under normal conditions.</p>

</div>

<p>The Aneroid, like the Mercurial barometer may be used either as a
weather indicator or in the measurement of altitudes. When used in
the former capacity, the Aneroid, especially at sea, possesses some
obvious advantages. Aside from its superior compactness of form and its
portability, it responds more readily to the changes in atmospheric
pressure than the Mercury column, and thereby serves more efficiently
to warn the mariner of sudden tempests.</p>

<p>The words Rain—Change—Fair seen stamped or engraved on the dial of
many barometers have, of course, no special significance, and are now
rarely seen on first-class instruments of either kind. The probable
changes of weather indicated by changes of the barometer are briefly
set forth in the following:

<p>It does not require the highest quality in the mechanism of an Aneroid
to serve the purpose indicated in the above rules.</p>

<p>For the accurate measurement of differences of altitude, however, the
best skill in construction and the most careful adjustment of the
parts is indispensably necessary. The use of an Aneroid of even medium
quality will frequently lead to considerable errors in estimating
heights. It may also be added here that instruments of the best
manufacture in the hands of observers unacquainted with the principles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
involved, will often lead to erroneous conclusions. This is owing in
many cases to a method adopted by some makers of adding a circle marked
<i>feet</i> outside of the common graduation to inches of mercury.</p>

<p>Many tourists carry Aneroids of the pocket size, and consult them
frequently while traveling, relying upon a single observation of the
index for the determination of their altitude.</p>

<p>If such a circle of feet be engraved on the dial plate with the
<i>zero</i> mark made to correspond with 30 inches of the mercury
column, of course every estimate of altitude made as above mentioned
assumes that at the moment of observation; the barometer at the level
of the sea would stand exactly at 30 inches; a condition only realized
occasionally. And the further condition is also assumed, that the
temperature of the air is of no account in estimating heights; an
assumption equally at variance with fact.</p>

<p>It is only an inferior class of Aneroids that bear a fixed graduated
circle of feet, with the zero of altitude corresponding to 30 inches of pressure.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>Prof. Airy, the former Astronomer Royal of Great Britain, prepared
a <a href="#Page_88">table</a> for the use of barometer makers—a scale
from which is now engraved on many English Aneroids. It places the zero
of altitude at 31 inches of pressure. This affords such large numbers
for slight elevations that the proper use of the rule is suggested
to the observer. He is led to subtract the two readings of feet to
get difference in height. But this again assumes that the average
temperature is 50° F.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_88">Table I</a> exhibits Prof. Airy’s series of heights.</p>

<p>Some makers, designing to improve upon the simple construction just
described, have engraved the outer circle of feet on a movable ring
encircling the dial, so that when an observer is at any locality whose
height is known, he may bring the proper mark of the altitude scale
against the index pointer. Then if the observer travels about over a
section of country, the pointer will indicate with fair approximation
for some hours the altitude of the new positions.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
This device is convenient to a skilled observer who only requires rapid
and approximate results, but to the novice it is misleading in two
ways; first, because the temperature is left out of the calculation,
and furthermore, such a use of the movable scale will, at times,
involve a large error, as it is not a scale of equal parts.</p>

<p>Mr. Rogers Field, C. E., in 1873, applied the movable scale to the
Aneroid, so as to convert it from a source of inaccuracy into an aid
towards accuracy. He employs the altitude scale proposed by Sir G. Airy
for temperature 50°, but he makes it movable so as to adjust it for any
other <i>temperature</i>. The shifting of the scale into certain fixed
positions, is made to answer the same purpose as if the original scale
were altered to suit various temperatures of the air. In the <i>Journal
of the Meteorological Society</i> for 1874, January, Mr. Field says:</p>

<p>“The object aimed at in designing this improved form of Aneroid was, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
simplify the correct determination of altitudes in cases such as
ordinarily occur in England, and the instrument is therefore arranged
to suit moderate elevations, say of 2000 feet and under, and is not
intended for more considerable heights.</p>

<p>“The Aneroid is graduated for inches in the usual way on the face,
but the graduation only extends from 31 inches to 27 inches so as to
preserve an open scale. The outer movable scale is graduated in feet
for altitudes, and this graduation is laid down by fixing the movable
scale with the zero opposite 31 inches. This is the normal position
of the scale and it is then correct for a temperature of 50°. For
temperatures below 50° the zero of the scale is moved below 31 inches;
for temperatures above 50°, the zero of the scale is moved above 31
inches. The exact position of the scale for different temperatures has
been determined partly by calculation and partly by trial, and marked
by figures engraved on the outside of the Aneroid. In order to insure
the altitude scale not being shifted, after it has once been set in its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
proper position there is a simple contrivance for locking it in the
various positions. This consists of a pin, which fits into a series
of notches on the outside of the ring carrying the glass. By slightly
raising the glass it is freed from this locking pin, and can be turned
until the figures corresponding to the air temperature are opposite to
the pin, when the glass should be depressed so as to relock it, and the
scale becomes correct for that temperature. The altitudes are in all
cases determined by taking two readings, one at each station, and then
subtracting the reading at the lower station from that at the upper.</p>

<p>“It will be seen from the foregoing description that the movable scale
of the instrument requires to be set for temperatures before taking
any observations, and must not be shifted during the progress of the
observations.</p>

<p>“This may appear at first sight as a defect, inasmuch as the
temperature of the air may alter during the progress of the
observations; but practically it will not be found to be any drawback
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
in the case of moderate altitudes, as small variations of temperature
will not appreciably affect the result. A variation of 5° of
temperature gives only about 1 per cent. variation in the altitude,
an amount that would under ordinary circumstances be inappreciable,
so that as long as the temperature does not vary during the course of
the observations more than 5° from that at which the instrument is
set, the results may be accepted as correct, and, generally speaking,
even a greater variation than this, say 6° or 8°, would be practically
of no importance. Of course, if it should be found at any time that
the temperature has varied considerably, during the course of the
observations, from that at which the instrument was set, this variation
can be allowed for by calculation in the usual way.”</p>

<p>The principle of allowing for variation of temperatures of the air
by shifting the altitude scale is not theoretically accurate, but
sufficiently so for practical purposes. For altitudes within the range
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
of the instrument (say 3000 feet and under) and temperatures between
30° and 70°, the maximum error from using the shifted scale, instead
of the calculation, is only 2 feet, which is inappreciable on the
scale. The same principle might even be applied to altitudes up to 6000
feet, as the maximum error would be only 10 feet. For considerable
elevations, however, the variations of the temperature between the base
and the summit would interfere with the application of the principle.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the best plan is to dispense with altitude scales,
whether fixed or movable, and to calculate the heights. Simple rules,
giving more reliable results than the attached scales, are at the

<p>This is for ordinary temperatures and pressures. If the pressure is

<p class="blockquot">To find the difference in height between two
stations: <i>Find the mean pressure; also the mean temperature. The
number in the table corresponding to these two means, if multiplied by
the difference of the barometric pressures in hundredths of an inch,
will give the difference in altitude very nearly.</i></p>

<p>In the absence of a table to aid in computation, but having an Aneroid
with the scale of feet, use the formula,</p>

<p><span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.738ex; width: 17.308ex; height: 4.837ex;" src="images/35.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\[
D = 55000 \frac{\mathrm H-h}{\mathrm H + h}
\]"></span></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
adding <img style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 3.395ex; height: 2.773ex;" src="images/36.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\frac{1}{500}\)"> of the estimated altitude for every degree,
the <i>average</i> temperature is above 55°, and subtracting a like
amount when it is below. D, is the difference of altitude in feet; H
and <i>h</i> are the readings <i>in feet</i> from the Aneroid scale.
This gives fair approximations up to 3000 feet.</p>

<p>For accurate results use one of the following methods: Having Airy’s
table (<a href="#Page_88">Table 1</a>) and an Aneroid carefully graduated
to inches; <i>Take the reading in inches of the barometric scale at
both lower and upper stations; also the temperature at both stations.
Find from the table the heights in feet corresponding to the barometer
readings. Subtract them and multiply the remainder by</i></p>

<p><span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.602ex; width: 13ex; height: 4.663ex;" src="images/37.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\[
\frac{\mathrm T + t-100}{1000}.
\]"></span></p>

<p>The complete formula is</p>

<p><span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.148ex; width: 32.391ex; height: 5.428ex;" src="images/38.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\[
D = (\mathrm H-h) \left(1 +  \frac{\mathrm T + t-100}{1000}\right)
\]"></span></p>

<p>T and <i>t</i> are the observed temperatures; H and <i>h</i> are the
heights in feet taken from the table.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>In the absence of this table, but with a table of logarithms at
hand, the barometric heights in inches are to be taken, and the
following formula used:</p>

<p><span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.148ex; width: 43.555ex; height: 5.428ex;" src="images/39.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\[
\mathrm D = 6000 (log. \mathrm B-log. b)\left(1 + \frac{\mathrm T + t-60}{900}\right).
\]"></span></p>

<p class="no-indent">B and <i>b</i> are the barometric readings in
inches; D, T and <i>t</i> as in the other formulas. (<a href="#Page_106">See Table II</a>.)</p>

<p>To avoid error from the constant changes in barometric pressure,
the observations should be simultaneous. This is accomplished in
the best manner by using two instruments, and requires, when the
distance between the stations is considerable, two observers. With one
instrument only, large errors are avoided by repeating the observation
at the first station after taking that at the 2d station, and assuming
that any change in barometric pressure that has occurred has been
gradual during the absence.</p>

<p>When it is impracticable to repeat the observation at the first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
station, the error which, in case of a changing pressure, might be
a large one, may be reduced if the observation at the 2d station be
continued for an hour or two, or until the rate of change can be
estimated and a proportionate correction applied.</p>

<p>Many Aneroids marked “compensated” exhibit a sensible change when the
temperature is varied; such instruments may be serviceable and quite
accurate if allowance be made for the error of the instrument. This
correction the owner had better determine by experiment. It is easy to
subject the Aneroid to such variation of temperature as shall embrace
the range at which it is likely to be used, and the movement of the
index for each 10° or 20° of temperature recorded.</p>

<p>Aneroids require to be compared from time to time with a good mercurial
barometer. While making such comparisons, it is well to remember that
the mercurial column and the scale by which it is measured both require
correcting, and that during times of rapid changes, in atmospheric
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
pressure, the Aneroid shows such changes more readily than the
mercurial barometer. (<a href="#Page_125">See Table IV</a>.)</p>

<p>In measuring heights with the Aneroid care should be taken that the
instrument is not influenced by the heat of the hand nor by the direct
rays from the sun.</p>

<p>The instrument should always be tapped gently with the finger at the
moment of taking an observation. It should also be held in the same
position for both observations; preferably with the face horizontal.</p>

<p>Considerable care is also required to determine exactly where the index
points. It is best accomplished by sighting along the pointer, using
one eye only for the purpose.</p>

<p>The following example will illustrate the use of the tables.</p>

<table class="fontsize_120 no-wrap" style='border-collapse:collapse;'>

      <td class="tdr">Barometer at Station A</td>

</table>

<p>From <a href="#Page_88">Table I</a> we find height corresponding to
reading at A is 857 feet. The height for B is 2120 feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
The approximate height is 2120-857 = 1263 feet; but the sum of the
temperatures is 143°. An additional correction of <img style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.195ex; height: 2.79ex;" src="images/40.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\tfrac{43}{1000}\)">
is, therefore, to be applied to the above difference; this is 54 feet.
The total estimated difference of altitude is then 1263 + 54 = 1317 feet.</p>

<p>The formula directly applied is</p>

<p><span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -2.148ex; width: 49.818ex; height: 5.428ex;" src="images/41.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\[
D = (2120-858)\left(1+ \frac{78+65-100}{1000} \right) = 1317.21
\]"></span></p>

<p>Applying the logarithmic formula we have:</p>

<p><span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -8.839ex; width: 40.642ex; height: 18.809ex;" src="images/42.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\[

\log. \; \mathrm B-\log. \; b &= 0.020121
}
\\
D = 60000(.020121)\left(1+ \frac{78+65-60}{900} \right)\\
= 1207.26 \times 1 \tfrac{83}{900} = 1318 \text{feet}.
\end{gather}
\]"></span></p>

<p>As before remarked, the Goldschmid Aneroid requires that both the
temperature of the air and of the instrument be carefully taken. Two
examples of altitudes taken with the instrument previously referred to
(No. 3187) will serve to show the kind of correction necessary, and as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
both examples apply to the same mountain (Kiarsarge of Conway, N. H.,)
they will together indicate the character of the instrument</p>

<p>The <i>Tribune</i> report, however, indicates a rise on this date of
.07 between 7 and 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> If such a change was felt in this
region, then the calculated height of the mountain is too low by at
least 60 feet. On the other hand, a height given by railway survey in
this vicinity, (Johnson’s Mill) near the camp, seems to confirm the
figures given here.</p>

<p>Also, the height of Helsinger Notch, taken incidentally on this

the summit of Slide Mountain 4205 feet.</p>

<p>The height of the base at Neversink was established by four

comparison with the height of the railway track at Liberty, six miles south-west.

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br>
<span class="h_subtitle">SUGGESTIONS IN REGARD TO THE<br>
SELECTION AND SYSTEMATIC<br> USE OF AN ANEROID.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Dealers in good aneroids are generally prepared to testify in regard
to the performance of their instruments when tested by the air pump.
Comparison tables frequently accompany first-class instruments which
show the differences between the aneroid referred to and a standard
mercurial barometer submitted to the same exhaustion.</p>

<p>The buyer may reasonably ask, therefore, that such a test may be made
if it has not been previously done.</p>

<p>The best English aneroids are now marked <i>compensated</i>, and are
presumably free from error arising from changes of temperature in the
instrument itself. Whether such be the case can readily be determined,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
by the owner of the instrument subjecting it to the action of a
freezing mixture and then of a drying oven, while the normal pressure
remains the same. A thermometer should be placed beside the aneroid
during the trial. A range of temperature from 15° F. to 175° F. may
easily be produced, and a coefficient of correction if the instrument is
not compensated, may be determined.</p>

<p>The graduations of a good instrument are neatly engraved on the dial.</p>

<p>The divisions corresponding to the inches and fractions of a mercurial
barometer are the only essential ones. The circle of feet, whether
movable or fixed, is a convenience of secondary importance.</p>

<p>If an aneroid bears a fixed circle of feet with the zero mark
corresponding to the 30-inch point of the other scale, the
probabilities are that the instrument is not from one of the best
makers.</p>

<p>Excellent aneroids are now made with dial plates only 2½ inches in
diameter. The Casella barometer referred to in the examples has a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
diameter of only 1¼ inches. Of course the smaller fractions of an
inch are more easily read on dials of 4 inches in diameter; but the
portability of the smaller instruments recommends them for the use of
the topographer, and the medium size, which is from 2¼ to 2½ inches, is
now most in demand for surveyor’s work.</p>

<p>The aneroids in any considerable collection will be found to be
variously graduated; some of them capable of indicating a fall of
pressure to 20 inches, corresponding to a height of over 11,000 feet,
while many are designed for continual use below 3,000 feet of altitude.
In two instruments of the same diameter, but differing as above, it
is clear that the latter will have the larger scale divisions, and
will, therefore, be the better instrument to use <i>at the lower
altitudes</i>.</p>

<p>It should be carefully remembered that all aneroids vary in their
readings, with the position in which they are held; reading always a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
little higher with the dial horizontal (face uppermost), than when
it is vertical. The difference is clearly owing to the direct weight
of the mechanism exerted on the vacuum box. There is no objection
to allowing this weight to be always added, but the practice of the
observer should be uniform, and to read from the horizontal dial is
probably the most convenient practice.</p>

<p>A tap with the finger just before taking the reading is required to
bring the springs to their proper bearing. Also, in case of rapid
ascents, as some aneroids will not, at the moment of attaining an
altitude, indicate the entire fall of pressure, a few minutes’ delay is
necessary.</p>

<p>The pointer should be fine and very close to the graduated scale, and
the reading should be taken by looking along the direction of the
pointer.</p>

<p>For ordinary work it should not be considered important to adjust the
aneroid to an absolute agreement with the mercurial barometer. The
difference between the readings may be noted, but to force the aneroid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
to an agreement by aid of the adjusting screw is a questionable practice.</p>

<p>Whenever comparison with the mercury column is made, the reduction for
the latter by <a href="#Page_125">Table 4</a> should be carefully observed.</p>

<p>In the use of either form of Aneroid, whether it has been furnished
with a correction  or not, the observer should take early means
to become acquainted with its limits of error under various conditions
of temperature or pressure. Repeated measurements of a known altitude
afford good data for such information, but direct comparisons, for a
long time, with a standard cistern barometer will yield, with a minimum
of labor, the greatest number of comparisons.</p>

<p>For the method of dealing with such data to determine correction
coefficients, the reader is referred to the larger treatises, the most
exhaustive of which, probably, is “Die Aneroide,” by Josef Höltschl
(Alfred Holder, Vienna, 1872).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>For ordinary use of a single instrument, however, the corrections,
if any are necessary, are determined with sufficient accuracy by the
exercise of ordinary skill and patience; skill here implying, also,
systematic trial.</p>

<p>Some of the sources of error in measuring altitudes, which are not
to be eliminated by any adjustment or correction of instruments, are
clearly stated by Prof. Elias Loomis, in a paper read before the
National Academy of Sciences, April 19, 1881.</p>

<p>“The Laplace formula assumed that the atmosphere has attained a
condition of equilibrium, and in such a case it gives the reduction
to sea level with tolerable accuracy. The average of a long series of
observations represents approximately such a condition of equilibrium;
but in the daily observations this equilibrium is very much disturbed.
The mean between the temperatures at the upper and lower stations does
not represent the average temperature of the intermediate column of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
air; and when the atmosphere is in rapid motion the downward pressure
is modified by the earth’s rotation, in a manner not represented by the
Laplace formula. There is no doubt that the formulæ of reduction now
employed may be considerably improved; but it does not seem possible
that any single formula, with constant coefficients, should provide for
the immense variety of conditions which prevail in the neighborhood of
mountain stations; and we may be compelled for each mountain region to
adopt tables founded upon a direct comparison of observations made at
stations of different elevations and not very remote from each other.”</p>

<p>The following remarks bearing upon the same subject are from an article
by J. Allan Brown, F. R. S., on “Periodic Oscillations of Barometric
Pressure,” published in <i>Nature</i> in April, 1881:</p>

<p>Sedgwick has said: [“To explain difficulties in these questions”
(relating to pressure and temperature) “the atmospheric strata have
been shuffled in accordance with laboratory experience.”]
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>“If we suppose that the attraction of gravity is not the only
attraction which affects the pressure of the atmosphere, but that
this pressure varies through some other attracting force—such as an
electric attraction of the sun depending upon the varying humidity
of the air, and this again depending on its temperature, we should
find another method of relating the two variations which does not
exist if gravitation alone is employed. It is quite certain that many
physicists will not admit the idea of an electric attraction on our
atmosphere in the present state of our knowledge, hence the efforts
to make expansion, and a shuffling of the atmospheric strata suffice.
We must not, however, in our ignorance, attempt to force conclusions
in opposition to facts, and if these can be satisfied more easily and
with greater probabilities in its favor by the aid of the hypothesis of
an electric attraction of the sun, that hypothesis will have a better
claim to acceptance than the other. I shall here note a few facts which
cannot be explained by thermic actions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“1. I have shown that, on the average of many years’ observation in
our latitudes, the mean pressure diminishes at the rate of 0″.038
of mercury for every one hundred miles we proceed toward the north.
This has been called a gradient from the similar term used in railway
slopes: but it is no slope, it is a level of a surface of equilibrium
like that of the sea. It is the mean heights of the barometer at
the sea level which indicate the form, if we may so say, of the
equilibrating atmosphere.</p>

<p>“2. In India we have seen that the atmospheric pressure oscillates
at each station even when these are quite near to each other,
independently of the known laws of equilibrium of gases. When we turn
to the semi-diurnal oscillation of the barometer we are only amused at
the attempts made to explain it by shuffling the atmospheric strata.
Nothing can be more certain than that the theories of expansion, or
resistance to expansion and overflow, are the vain efforts to make the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
laws of nature agree with a theory. Over the great ocean within the
tropics, where the diurnal variations of temperature are small and the
air is absolutely without perceptible currents for days together, the
barometer rises and falls a tenth of an inch twice in twenty-four hours
with the regularity of the solar clock. The action of the sun on the
whole atmosphere which produces this movement varies chiefly during the
day hours at inland stations with the temperature oscillation, so that,
as in the case of the annual variation, the fall of the barometer at
4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> is greater in the same latitude as the
temperature is higher. This variation occurs during the most complete
calms; the smoke rises vertically from the plain of Tinnevelly; no
current is visible in the motion of the clouds; yet the barometer falls
at four in the morning as it did at four in the afternoon, only it
falls less.”</p>

<p>It seems probable that the use of the Aneroid will soon become more
widely extended, and that engineers, when made familiar with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
qualities of well-made instruments, will welcome so valuable an aid
in preliminary surveys. The conditions of satisfactory work with
barometers are certainly peculiar, and to field workers familiar only
with the level and transit, may seem unique. But when the conditions
are fully understood, the engineer may easily take precautions which
will avoid too large errors, and conduct surveys in hilly regions with
a celerity not heretofore attained.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><b><span class="smcap">Rule.</span></b>—Find
in the table the logarithms of the barometer readings to hundredths
of an inch. Subtract these logarithms and multiply the remainder by
60000. The product is the approximate difference in altitude between
the two stations. To apply the corrections for temperature, add the
temperatures of the two stations and subtract 60°. Increase the above
approximate value by <img style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 3.395ex; height: 2.773ex;" src="images/53.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\(\tfrac{1}{900}\)"> of itself for each degree of
excess above 60°. If the sum of the temperature is <i>less</i> than 60°
diminish the value by a like amount.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
